## About the Project
<hr style="border: 1px solid lilac">

“Skincare Sleuth” is a react application made for skincare junkies who love to read up on skincare ingredients so they can make better informed decisions on their purchases. This application will allow users to curate a personalized skincare routine by adding products to their routine, search up the ingredients of their favorite products and also save them to a list for later reference.

Skincare is a journey for many which requires a lot of trial and error, there are a number of ingredients which can do wonders for our skin or the complete opposite, it's easy to get overwhelmed with choosing the right products for your skintype let alone creating a skincare routine for yourself. This application's purpose is for you to feel empowered about the purchases you make amidst all of the misinformation on the internet. Hence the name "Skincare Slueth", where "sleuth" means to investigate and discover, just like you on your skincare adventure!!!

## MVP User Stories  
<hr style="border: 1px solid lavender"> 

- As a user, I want to browse different skincare ingredients so I can read what each one is suggested for.
- As a user I want to add my skincare products to my own routine that works for my skincare concerns and lifestyle.
- As a user i want to add skincare products to my favorites so I can try them out after I use up the products I currently have.

## IceBox Items
<hr style="border: 1px solid lavender"> 
-Add oAuth so users can save their favorites and their routines
- As a user I want to be able to search up my skincare concerns and look at suggested ingredients to improve my skin texture.
- As a user, I want to be able to take a skincare quiz so I can put in my age, lifestyle, concerns so a skincare routine is suggested for me.
- As a user I want to be able to post my skincare questions for other users to talk about their favorite products/routines
-implement full CRUD on every component

## Choosing an API
<hr style="border: 1px solid lavender"> 

- I went with Open Beauty Facts API, this is a huge list encompassing not only popular skincare products but food items as well, this was the easiest to access (meaning free) and the one that closely aligned with the goals of my project. Unfortunately, it has not been updated in over 2 years and there are some discrepencies with the information.
- I was considering EWG Skin Deep API, the issue with this one is that it is heavily biased against skincare that doesn't have "natural" ingredients meaning it demonizes skincare ingredients which get a bad rep but are commonly used to stablize ingredients for example.
-I applied for Sephora API but I got denied because I don't have valid credentials as I up a mere bootcamp student at this time....

## Wireframe and Planning:
<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc">

This was my ideal color palette and font choices, I really like light purple as a base for this application. I also aimed to find simple easy to read fonts for this project
