## About the Project
<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc">

Book Club is a full-stack web application which allows users to browse, and review books. Each user has the ability to read, create and delete both book reviews and notable quotes from the book of their choice. Book Club was designed so that readers can have a community where they can log and keep track of the books they read while also interacting with other user's to share or discuss differing opinion.

## Getting Started

## Wireframe:

The images below show how we designed our application, we had some trouble trying to choose an optimal style for users but we decided to go with the most user friendly and simple set-up.

A user will be able to start on the home page with the index of current books on the website. From there they can choose a book they are interested in learning about or a book that they have already read. Once they click on the book cover they are interested in they will be redirected to another page where they can see the  Title, Author, and Summary of the book. There may be some reviews and notable quotes already on the page if the book has been there for a while and they can choose to add, edit or delete the reviews and notable quotes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
